SYNOPSIS
==========

``pyi-makespec`` <options> SCRIPT [SCRIPT ...]

DESCRIPTION
============

The spec file is the description of what you want |PyInstaller| to do
with your program. ``pyi-makespec`` is a simple wizard to create spec
files that cover basic usages::

       py-Makespec [--onefile] yourprogram.py

By default, ``pyi-makespec`` generates a spec file that tells
|PyInstaller| to create a distribution directory contains the main
executable and the dynamic libraries. The option ``--onefile``
specifies that you want PyInstaller to build a single file with
everything inside.

In most cases the specfile generated by ``pyi-makespec`` is all you
need. If not, see `When things go wrong` in the manual and be sure to
read the introduction to `Spec Files`.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

                       files. The default location for this is operating system
                       dependent, but is typically a subdirectory of the home
                       directory.
